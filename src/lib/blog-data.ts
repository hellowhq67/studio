      <h2>Step 1: Skin Preparation is Key</h2>
      <p>Before you even think about foundation, a clean and moisturized canvas is crucial. Start with a gentle cleanser, followed by a hydrating toner and a lightweight moisturizer. Let your skincare products absorb for at least 5 minutes. For an extra smooth base, apply a primer suited for your skin type—mattifying for oily skin, hydrating for dry skin, or pore-filling for visible pores.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 2: Choose the Right Tool</h2>
      <p>The tool you use can dramatically change the finish of your foundation. A damp beauty sponge (like a Beautyblender) provides a sheer, natural finish. A dense foundation brush offers fuller coverage, while a stippling brush gives an airbrushed effect. Experiment to see what you prefer.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 3: Application Technique</h2>
      <p>Start with a small amount of foundation—you can always add more. Apply it to the center of your face (forehead, nose, chin) and blend outwards. Use dabbing or stippling motions rather than wiping, which can cause streaks. Ensure you blend down to your neck to avoid a harsh line.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 4: Set It and Forget It</h2>
      <p>To lock your foundation in place all day, set it with a translucent powder. Use a large, fluffy brush for a light dusting or a powder puff to press the powder into areas that tend to get oily, like the T-zone. Finish with a setting spray to melt the powders into the skin for a seamless, non-cakey look.</p>

      <h2>1. Hyaluronic Acid: The Hydration Hero</h2>
      <p>Hyaluronic Acid is a humectant that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water, making it a superstar for hydration. It plumps up the skin, reduces the appearance of fine lines, and gives a dewy, supple look. It's suitable for all skin types.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Vitamin C: The Brightening Powerhouse</h2>
      <p>An essential antioxidant, Vitamin C protects the skin from environmental damage, boosts collagen production, and brightens the complexion by inhibiting melanin production. Look for it in serums and apply it in the morning for all-day protection.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Retinol (Vitamin A): The Age-Defier</h2>
      <p>Retinol is the gold standard for anti-aging. It accelerates cell turnover, which helps to reduce wrinkles, fine lines, and even acne. Start with a low concentration and use it only at night, as it can make your skin sensitive to the sun. Always wear SPF the next day.</p>
      
      <h2>4. Niacinamide (Vitamin B3): The Multitasker</h2>
      <p>Niacinamide is incredibly versatile. It helps to minimize pores, regulate oil production, improve the skin barrier, and even out skin tone. It's gentle and can be easily combined with other ingredients in your routine.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Ceramides: The Barrier Builders</h2>
      <p>Ceramides are lipids that are naturally found in the skin and are essential for a healthy skin barrier. A strong barrier keeps moisture in and irritants out. Adding ceramides to your routine helps to repair and maintain this crucial protective layer, preventing dryness and irritation.</p>

      <p>Summer fun shouldn't mean sacrificing your hair's health. Here's how to protect it.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Cover Up:</strong> Wear a hat or scarf to protect your hair and scalp from direct UV rays, which can cause damage and color fading.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a UV Protectant Spray:</strong> Just like skin, hair needs sun protection. A leave-in spray with UV filters can shield your strands from sun damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Swim Rinse:</strong> Before diving into the pool or ocean, wet your hair with clean water and apply a leave-in conditioner. This prevents your hair from absorbing as much chlorine or salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarify and Condition:</strong> Use a clarifying shampoo once a week to remove chlorine and product buildup. Follow up with a deep conditioning mask to restore moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Hot Tools:</strong> Give your hair a break from heat styling. Embrace natural textures, braids, or updos to minimize damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrate from Within:</strong> Drink plenty of water. Healthy hair starts from the inside out.</li>
        <li><strong>Get a Trim:</strong> Start and end the summer with a trim to get rid of split ends and keep your hair looking fresh.</li>
      </ol>
